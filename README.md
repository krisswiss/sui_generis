# Sui Generis
Sui Generis meaning “one of a kind” or “unique” is the exact description of this business model.

The aim of the company is to offer customers a unique shopping experience by giving them a choice of buying ready-made hampers or the chance to create their own without a limit on product selection.

Stock images have been used for this project but the companies aim would be to offer brands that are not in the mainstream market which would then truly reflect the name Sui Generis.
